# E2E status: upstream test suite against the emulator

The upstream end-to-end suite (`firmware/1541ultimate/tests`, `./run-tests`, `tests/README.md`) was run against
the emulator with the unmodified upstream `ultimate.elf`. `/v1/info` reports Ultimate 64-II, firmware 3.15, git
b617777c. The runner detected no need for recovery in any run.

The tables below were measured with the T0 C64 stub, before TRX64 became the default C64. After the wave-3 merge,
`E2E_REST_SHIM=1 scripts/run-e2e.sh smoke` with the default `--c64 trx64` passes 12 of 12 suite runs again (19.0 s
total in the runner's summary). The quick profile, and with it E1 (no C64 CPU), was not re-run.

## Result

| Profile | Raw | With REST shim | Suite time, raw / shim |
|---|---|---|---|
| smoke | 11 of 12 OK, exit 3 | **12 of 12 OK, exit 0** | 35 s / 19 s |
| quick (default) | 18 of 27 OK, exit 3 | 21 of 27 OK, exit 3 | 522 s / 792 s |

- **Raw** is the upstream harness unchanged. The smoke failure and 3 of the 9 quick failures come from suites that
  build REST URLs without the port override (H1).
- **Shim** is the same run with `E2E_REST_SHIM=1`, which sends loopback port 80 to the REST forward (see Setup).
- The 6 quick failures left with the shim break down as follows:
  - 5 emulator gaps (E1-E5);
  - 1 test assumption about the network (H2).
- No firmware bug was found.

## Reproduce

```sh
export UE2_FIRMWARE=/path/to/firmware/1541ultimate
scripts/run-e2e.sh smoke                    # report: run/e2e/runs/smoke/index.md
scripts/run-e2e.sh quick                    # report: run/e2e/runs/quick/index.md
E2E_REST_SHIM=1 scripts/run-e2e.sh smoke    # report: run/e2e/runs/smoke-shim/index.md
E2E_REST_SHIM=1 scripts/run-e2e.sh quick    # report: run/e2e/runs/quick-shim/index.md
```

A profile run executes these steps:

1. Build the release binary.
2. Create `run/e2e/venv` from `tests/requirements.txt` (Python 3.12.11) and the SD image
   (`scripts/make-sd-image.sh`), if they are missing.
3. Boot the emulator:

   ```sh
   target/release/ue2emu run --headless --speed realtime \
       --firmware $UE2_FIRMWARE/target/u64ii/riscv/ultimate/result/ultimate.elf --roms $UE2_FIRMWARE/roms \
       --flash run/e2e/flash.bin --sd run/e2e/sd.img --control 127.0.0.1:16400 --net user \
       --hostfwd tcp:18080:80,tcp:18021:21,tcp:18023:23,tcp:18064:64,tcp:51000:51000,...,tcp:52999:52999
   ```

4. Wait for `/v1/version`. REST answered 2 s after start in every run.
5. Run the suite and render the report:

   ```sh
   U64_REST_PORT=18080 U64_FTP_PORT=18021 U64_TELNET_PORT=18023 U64_DMA_PORT=18064 \
       run/e2e/venv/bin/python $UE2_FIRMWARE/run-tests --profile smoke -o run/e2e/runs/smoke 127.0.0.1
   run/e2e/venv/bin/python $UE2_FIRMWARE/tools/e2e_report.py run/e2e/runs/smoke
   ```

6. Send `quit` on the control port, so the flash image is flushed.

The firmware console goes to `run/e2e/emu-<run>.log`. `scripts/run-e2e.sh up` and `down` boot and stop the same
machine for single suites; export the four `U64_*_PORT` variables before starting a suite by hand. All runs here
shared one `run/e2e/flash.bin`. The runner writes back every setting a run changed.

## Setup

- **Ports.**
  - macOS 27 refuses an unprivileged bind of 127.0.0.1 on ports 80, 21, 23 and 64 (EACCES, checked with a Python
    bind). It allows the bind on 0.0.0.0, but that would put the device on the LAN.
  - The suite moves every port through `U64_REST_PORT`, `U64_FTP_PORT`, `U64_TELNET_PORT` and `U64_DMA_PORT`
    (tests/lib/targets.py:77-80) and accepts `127.0.0.1` as the target.
- **FTP passive ports.**
  - ftplib opens the data connection to the control connection's peer, on the port from the PASV reply.
  - The firmware hands out passive ports in sequence from 51000 and wraps at 61000 (ftpd.cc:324-327,400-413).
  - Forwarding all 10 000 ports failed: 127.0.0.1:55555 was already taken on the host (ephemeral range), and a single
    failed hostfwd stops the machine.
  - The script forwards 51000-52999, which covers 2000 passive transfers per boot.
  - With these 2004 forwards the emulator holds realtime: 25 MIPS emulated, about 24 % of one host core.
- **REST shim.**
  - Six suites connect to port 80 whatever the target says (H1).
  - With `E2E_REST_SHIM=1` the script writes `run/e2e/shim/sitecustomize.py` and puts it on `PYTHONPATH`. It wraps
    `socket.create_connection` and sends 127.0.0.1:80 to `U64_REST_PORT`.
  - urllib, http.client and httpx/httpcore all connect through that function.
- **Firmware tree stays read-only.**
  - The script sets `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` and `RUFF_CACHE_DIR=run/e2e/ruff-cache`.
  - Without the second, the lint suite writes `.ruff_cache` into the checkout. The first run did; that directory was
    deleted.
- **Health sweep.**
  - Before every device suite the sweep reads `ping rest ftp telnet ident dma heap raster -> OK`, with `jiffy=skip`.
  - Two entries prove less than on hardware:
    - `ping` reaches the Mac's own loopback.
    - `raster` moves because the T0 DMA window advances `$D012` on each read (c64.rs:111-161, doc 10 T0), not because
      a VIC runs.
  - `jiffy` is skipped by the harness's own rule: `$00A2` static under a moving raster (tests/lib/health.py).

## Smoke profile

Device = the suite drives the emulator (health sweep in front of it). The check counts are from the shimmed run.
The raw run has the same counts, except readmem-writemem, which failed its first check (0/1/0) in all 3 attempts.

## Triage

### H1: REST URL without the port (test assumption: the device serves port 80)

These suites format `http://{host}{path}` themselves, so `U64_REST_PORT` never reaches them. Raw runs fail with
`Connection refused` on 127.0.0.1:80. The shared client adds the port (tests/lib/rest.py:389-390). The fix belongs
upstream: use `rest.url_for` or `target.rest_port`. A device that serves port 80 never shows the problem.

| Suite | Where (tests/) | With the shim |
|---|---|---|
| readmem-writemem | e2e/api/readmem_writemem_test.py:131 | OK, 78 checks |
| input | e2e/api/input_test.py:228 | FAIL, E1 |
| openapi-contract | e2e/api/openapi_contract_test.py:110 (`base_url="http://%s"`) | OK |
| browser-long-filename | e2e/filemanager/browser_long_filename_test.py:76,108,291 | FAIL, E3 |
| ftp-client | e2e/filesystem/ftp_client_test.py:168 (`HTTPConnection` without a port) | FAIL, H2 |
| assembly64 | e2e/io/c64/assembly64_test.py:243,257 | OK, 46 checks |

### H2: ftp-client needs the device to reach the host at the host's own address

- **Setup.** The suite serves pyftpdlib on 0.0.0.0:2121 and makes the device connect to it.
- **Address.** It advertises the local end of a UDP socket connected to the target (ftp_client_test.py:2100-2117),
  which is 127.0.0.1 here. Behind slirp that is the guest's own loopback; the host is 10.0.2.2.
- **Shim run.** The host entry is created through the New Host form, then
  `[10] enter host: server sees login + TYPE I + LIST ... FAIL (missing FTP commands (PASS=False LIST=False))`.
- **By hand.** With the shim and `--ftp-advertised-host 10.0.2.2`, all 6 smoke-stage operations pass: create host,
  list host, enter/LIST, root entries, RETR README (52 bytes), remove host. The runner cannot pass that option.

### E1: no C64 CPU (doc 10 T0, S14)

The T0 C64 is a 64 K byte array. Nothing executes 6510 code, so there is no KERNAL and no READY prompt.

- **input:** `BASIC READY prompt not visible; device may be running a cartridge`. tests/lib/api.py:222-235 polls
  screen RAM for READY.
- **rest-api-coverage [49] machine:reset and [50] machine:reboot:** `the C64 did not reach the BASIC prompt`.
- **printer [05] epson/bitmap:** `FAIL_TIMEOUT` after 60 s. `printer_e2e.prg` must run and fill a status block that
  the suite polls with readmem (printer/printer_test.py:365-404). Checks [01]-[04] pass: REST, reset, load PRG,
  capture settings.

### E2: no audio/video stream (doc 10 §Streams, OPEN QUESTION 5)

freezer-audio [01] fails with `no audio packets captured` (io/c64/freezer_audio_test.py:81-84). The FPGA generates
the U64 streams as UDP (ETHSTREAM_ENA, `U64_UDP_BASE`, data_streamer.cc:386-404). The emulator models none of this,
and it has no SID output to measure either.

### E3: Flash Disk not provisioned

- **Cause.**
  - The firmware loads drive ROMs from `/flash/roms` (c64.h:12). The default file is `1541.rom` (c1541.cc:51); a
    failed load returns `SSRET_NO_DRIVE_ROM` (c1541.cc:927-935).
  - On hardware the U64-II FAT preparer writes `1541.rom`, `1571.rom`, `1581.rom` and the drive sound banks there
    (u64ii_prepare_fat/flash_disk_prep.cc:83-92).
  - `run/e2e/flash.bin` starts erased.
- **rest-api-coverage [54]-[57]:** drive mount answers HTTP 412 `Drive ROM not found`.
- **rest-api-coverage [58]:** set_mode answers `Invalid Drive Type 'Unknown'`.
- **browser-long-filename [05]:** browser mount fails with
  `drive_a={'enabled': False, 'type': 'Unknown', 'rom': 'Unable to load!'}`.
- **openapi-contract skips [03], [04]:** `this firmware predates the update that writes /Flash/html/openapi.yaml`
  (and `api.html`). Same missing update step; the firmware version is not the cause.
- **Console:** `Failed to load KERNAL ROM; loading default.` and `Failed to load CHAR ROM; loading default.`

Closing this needs a Flash Disk laid out the way the updater leaves it.

### E4: second drive not advertised

rest-api-coverage [51] fails with `drive b missing from the listing: ['IEC Drive', 'Printer Emulation', 'a']`. The T0
capability word 0x34000222 leaves out `CAPAB_DRIVE_1541_2` (itu.h:51). Drive B is only created when that bit is set
(c1541.cc:1260-1265; docs/hw/00 §3 C4, Q-B1).

### E5: REST connections reset when they overlap (network path, S12)

- **In the suite.**
  - rest-api-coverage runs its cases on 3 workers (e2e/api/rest_api_coverage_test.py:1112-1123). Upstream records
    that the U64 and C64U "answer three at a time" (tests/lib/machine.py:390-397).
  - 8 checks fail on every attempt, for E1, E3 and E4. On top of those, cases fail with `ConnectionResetError` or
    `BrokenPipeError` on the forwarded port: [08]/[09] GET /v1/info, [44] writemem, [45] input, [60]-[78] refusals,
    [82] streams stop.
  - Total FAILs per attempt: raw 28, 8, 11; shimmed 12, 12, 11. Which cases get reset changes every time.
- **Measured outside the suite.** http.client, `GET /v1/info`, `Connection: close`, 30 requests per row, realtime
  emulator:

  | Clients | Stagger between connection opens | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | - | 30 × HTTP 200 |
  | 2 | 0 | 17 × 200, 13 reset or broken pipe |
  | 3 | 0 | 11 × 200, 19 reset |
  | 3 | 100 ms | 30 × 200 |
  | 3 | 300 ms | 30 × 200 |

- **Speed.**
  - At `--speed max` (about 8× more instructions per wall-clock second), 60 serial requests still all succeed.
  - 3 unstaggered clients still lose 43 of 60: 17 × 200, 31 reset, 6 broken pipe, 6 other OSError.
  - At realtime the same test lost 59 of 60.
  - Emulated CPU speed makes it worse, but is not the cause.
- **Firmware limits do not explain it.**
  - `MAX_HTTP_CLIENT` is 5, with `listen(sock, 5)` (httpd/FreeRTOS/lib/server.h:14, server.c:65).
  - `DEFAULT_ACCEPTMBOX_SIZE` is 8 and `MEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB` is 30 (network/config/lwipopts.h:203,937).
- **Does not reproduce on Linux.** The table above was measured on macOS against a firmware built from the
  1541ultimate tree. `run/e5/hammer.py` is the same measurement as a standalone script (N threads, `GET /v1/info`,
  `Connection: close`, no stagger unless asked); on Ubuntu 26.04 under WSL2 with libslirp 4.9.1, against the
  released 3.15a application from `update_v3.15a.ue2`, it finds **no resets at all** in any configuration tried:

  | Speed | Forwards | Clients x requests | Result |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | realtime | 1 | 1x30, 2x15, 3x10 | all 200, and 3 clients staggered 100 ms and 300 ms likewise |
  | realtime | 1 | 3x10, 5x10, 8x10, 16x10 | all 200 (350 requests) |
  | max | 1 | 3x20, 8x20, 16x20 | all 200 (540 requests) |
  | realtime | 2004 | 1x10, 3x10, 8x10 | all 200 |

  The last row rules out a third candidate this section did not list: that the ~2000 passive-FTP forwards
  `run-e2e.sh` installs make each `slirp_pollfds_fill` walk enough sockets to starve the guest. They cost
  wall-clock time (8 clients take 3.2 s against 2.2 s with one forward) and no resets.
- **Root cause: still not isolated, but the candidates have moved.** The two originally listed were:
  - frames arriving as one burst per pump slice, where the RMII model drops a frame when no free buffer ID is
    queued (rmii.rs:170);
  - libslirp's handling of a guest that accepts slowly.

  `rmii.rs` is host-independent Rust, so if the first were the whole story it should reproduce on Linux under the
  heavier load above, and it does not - which makes it unlikely rather than excluded, since a differently built
  firmware could refill the free queue at a different rate. The libslirp candidate is likewise not supported by
  4.9.1 on Linux. What is left uncontrolled is the pair the Linux run could not hold fixed: the **macOS host** and
  the **dev firmware build**. Repeating `hammer.py` on macOS against the released .ue2 separates those two in one
  measurement, and is the next step rather than the packet capture this section used to recommend.
  `receive()` drops silently, so an RX-drop counter on the RMII model would settle the first candidate outright
  whichever host it runs on.
- **Unrelated.** The console lines `ERROR reading from socket -1. Errno = 104` belong to the Telnet UI session
  (`User Interface on stream returned`). The health sweep's Telnet probe connects and closes at once, which is the
  reset they report.

## Not covered

- Only the overlay transport (the smoke and quick default). The freeze and telnet sweeps of deep and exhaustive
  were not run.
- One run per profile, plus the raw smoke repeated with the final script. E5 makes the exact failing set of
  rest-api-coverage vary.
- The passive-port window allows 2000 FTP transfers per boot.
